                <h3>VOUS Church demo - Recreation of original site homepage.</h3>
                <a href="https://redv-2.github.io/vous-demo/">Check it out here</a>
                <p>This site is one I found while browsing for eye-catching and exciting web pages that can spark some inspiration
                    for my own.<br>It stood out for a few reasons to me; I loved the unique arrangements and layering of elements.
                    I also loved how they've made a monochromatic palette still feel vibrant and colourful using off-whites and dark greys.
                    The <a href="https://www.vouschurch.com/">original</a> really stuck some inspiration to my mind for the possibilities of web design, and
                    this can be seen in my replicated final.

                    <h3>Mid Kent Krav Maga - Client work</h3>
                    <a href="#">Check it out here</a>
                    <p>This was work done for a client, contrary to most of my works of which are mainly demonstrative.
                        This one is an example of what I can do when guided by a person's ideas rather than a preset design,
                        and how I can apply the ideas and themes of a company to their page.

                <a href="https://redv-2.github.io/tea-cozy/">Check it out here</a>
                <p>Originally a project from Codecademy when I would follow the work and projects on there,
                    I attemtped to develop the page beyond the expectation of the task by improving fonts, layout,
                    adding more content and improving the colour scheme.
