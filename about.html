        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
        <h4>Hi! My name is Curtis.</h4>
        <p>I am a driven and eager developer from Kent who is curious, inspired and
            unrelenting in my job, with a huge interest in the amazement of modern technology
            and programming.<br><br>
            I bring an energetic feel to the workplace and have plenty of experience within
            a variety of different environments along with customer service roles and customer
            facing experience. Bringing wit and professionalism, I try to keep my job a fun yet
            focused place and will make sure to supply a positive attitude and uplift those around me.
        </p>
        <h2>WORK EXPERIENCE</h2>
        <h4>Current Job - Bar And Kitchen Associate</h4>
        <h4>The Society Rooms, Maidstone (JD Wetherspoon)</h4>
        <p><em>October 2022 - Present</em><br><br>
        I have worked hard since the start within my time at Wetherspoon, working both within the kitchen
        and the bar, as per the training I was offered in my interview. I have been eager to progress in my
        role since the moment I joined, now trained in every section of the pub and able to confidently teach
        new employees and work with managers on many problems and the like.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Full-Stack Web Developer (Traineeship)</h4>
        <h4>IT Career Switch</h4>
        <p><em>September 2024 - September 2025</em><br><br>
            I learned, from the ground up, what entails Full-Stack Web Development, from the basics of HTML,
            CSS and JavaScript to different frameworks such as React and also began to learn PHP but due to
            managing a full-time job in between my learning was unsuccessful in completing the full curriculum within a year.
            I also created multiple projects and pages as a result of this traineeship, as can be viewed from 
            the projects section of this site.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Product Assembler</h4>
        <h4>Ascend Keyboards, Maidstone</h4>
        <p><em>September 2022 - Jan 2023</em><br><br>
            Fulfilling keyboard orders working alongside the directors to use Shopify to manage
            orders and responding to support tickets from customers via Discord. This was also a good
            experience working inside an office, of which my prior experience did not entail much of.
        </p>
        
        <br>
        <h4>Food Runner</h4>
        <h4>The Swan, West Malling</h4>
        <p><em>September 2021 - October 2022</em><br><br>
            Once more a customer-facing role, this role entailed running food, garnishing plates
            and occasionally helping the bar with polishing glasses. I was capable of training up and 
            helping manage the new staff, as well as taking orders for their dry store products.
