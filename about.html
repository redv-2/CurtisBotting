        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
        <h4>Hi! My name is Curtis.</h4>
        <p>I am a driven and eager developer from Kent who is curious, inspired and
            unrelenting in my job, with a huge interest in the amazement of modern technology
            and programming.<br><br>
            I bring an energetic feel to the workplace and have plenty of experience within
            a variety of different environments along with customer service roles and customer
            facing experience. Bringing wit and professionalism, I try to keep my job a fun yet
            focused place and will make sure to supply a positive attitude and uplift those around me.
        </p>
        <h2>WORK EXPERIENCE</h2>
        <h4>Current Job - Bar And Kitchen Associate</h4>
        <h4>The Society Rooms, Maidstone (JD Wetherspoon)</h4>
        <p><em>October 2022 - Present</em><br><br>
        I have worked hard since the start within my time at Wetherspoon, working both within the kitchen
        and the bar, as per the training I was offered in my interview. I have been eager to progress in my
        role since the moment I joined, now trained in every section of the pub and able to confidently teach
        new employees and work with managers on many problems and the like.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Full-Stack Web Developer (Traineeship)</h4>
        <h4>IT Career Switch</h4>
        <p><em>September 2024 - September 2025</em><br><br>
            I learned, from the ground up, what entails Full-Stack Web Development, from the basics of HTML,
            CSS and JavaScript to different frameworks such as React and also began to learn PHP but due to
            managing a full-time job in between my learning was unsuccessful in completing the full curriculum within a year.
            I also created multiple projects and pages as a result of this traineeship, as can be viewed from 
            the projects section of this site.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Product Assembler</h4>
        <h4>Ascend Keyboards, Maidstone</h4>
        <p><em>September 2022 - Jan 2023</em><br><br>
            Fulfilling keyboard orders working alongside the directors to use Shopify to manage
            orders and responding to support tickets from customers via Discord. This was also a good
            experience working inside an office, of which my prior experience did not entail much of.
        </p>
        
        <br>
        <h4>Food Runner</h4>
        <h4>The Swan, West Malling</h4>
        <p><em>September 2021 - October 2022</em><br><br>
            Once more a customer-facing role, this role entailed running food, garnishing plates
            and occasionally helping the bar with polishing glasses. I was capable of training up and 
            helping manage the new staff, as well as taking orders for their dry store products.
        </p>
        <h2>SKILLS</h2>
        <h4>Coding - Various Languages</h4>
        <p>My coding skills vary across both functional and visual code including Javascript, Python,
            Visual Basic, Lua, HTML and CSS.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Social and Professional Service</h4>
        <p>I have worked in customer service for over 5 years, ranging from coffee shops (Dunelm Pausa Cafe
            and Rambler's Rest for 2 months each respectively aged 16) and am adept in customer interaction,
            handling clients and upselling, marketing and many more social talents.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Hardware and CAD</h4>
        <p>Recently acquiring a home 3D printer, I have learned some essential skills in product design, CAD
            (particularly TinkerCAD, 2D Design for lasercutting and Orca Slicer for slicing),
            working with power tools and adhesion, bonding and many other useful hardware skills. At my
            current job I have also done odd fixes amongst the pub's furniture, hinges and non-specialised equipment
            such as ice scoop mounts and cupboard doors.
